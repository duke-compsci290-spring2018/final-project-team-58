It is displayed in 2nd person which is strange considering your searching for other people's opinions on the matter. Also, I think bullet points would be nice.",I really liked the different statistics determined by the app and how it displays them help group the similar demographics together by presentation design. It also does a good job comparing different searches.,"I disliked the tone analysis bar because it doesn't explain exactly what is does and how it works, so results of 2+ bars that total over 1 is hard to make sense of.  Also there is an automatic cap of 100 tweets analyzed making each result have a different data set to go off of. This causes even searches of the same topic to have gaps and discrepancies between points that make it hard to interpret what is actually most accurate.  ","If you compare the same search result against itself, there are gaps between data points as large as 11%. Also there are differences between the ""Likely to"" and ""Unlikely to"" categories that can be confusing which even change if the page is refreshed. Furthermore, in tone analysis there was an entire extra tone bar that isn't present in the other set. ","You could maybe add a button to show the full range of likely/unlikely opinions, and the choice of black for showing the harmony and emotional range traits is a bit strange. Possibly add a slider for the amount of tweets referenced as well?"

2018/09/30 10:46:35 PM EST,Kris Elbert,9,4,Yes,Yes,"This app is GORGEOUS. Love the calm but upbeat colors, the layout of the 3/4 circle chart, and the fact that the extra info button shows text that then stays there, and disappears when you click the button again.","I did not expect it to give me personality results, but because it says ""Users are likely/unlikely to..."" it makes me wonder if it is really showing results for people who responding positively (or negatively?). I had expected this to be just a tonal analyzer, and given this functionality is really cool, you should make it clearer that this website also gives you those results.","The Register button when signing in was not disabled when requirements were not met - it didn't do anything, but you could still click it with the ripple effect and all. 
I also tried to just type in 3dprinting, and that wasn't a valid hashtag - this is a little vague, I don't know if it was the number in front or if it's just not a common enough hashtag.
The tab title is just ""final"" which is probably fine, but easily changed to something more meaningful.
I like that the link to your personal website opens in a new tab, but you might want to make it https rather than http.","I searched for #billnye and got that I was likely to enjoy rap music, so that was interesting.
It works in split screen and everything flexes/grid/whatever you used in a sensible way. Still looks good at 200% zoom. The warning to bookmark or lose everything was great, but I wasn't sure when I had bookmarked something until clicking the button gave me the double-check window to ask if I wanted to delete it from my bookmarks.
I used this on Chrome with an NVDA screenreader, which didn't pick up any of your internal text or data, and didn't have much information about the buttons. NVDA is best with firefox, but it normally notices everything on the page.
Tabbing through the website made most sense, except the user nav bar goes right to left, which I found as a surprising tab order. Not all of the buttons clearly indicated focus was on them when the mouse was over them or the tab was on them - they get a little bit brighter, but with these colors, it needs to be made more noticable.
The screenreader did say the Hello <User Name>! was an h4 or h3 when your html has it as a span, so that was weird. Normally you'd want to arrange the nav buttons in a list so that screenreaders know how many buttons there are and that all of them are related by virtue of being in the nav bar.
The loading bar was great, icons appropriate, and it was overall a gorgeous experience. Fantastic job with both the functionality and the presentation - this is super duper cool and I will definitely be using it again, if it's still up!"
